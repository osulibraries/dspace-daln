<p><strong><a name="what" id="what"></a>What is Digital Space @ Xavier? </strong></p>
<p>Digital Space @ Xavier is a repository for all Xavier University scholarly communication, creative pedagogical works, and historical 
materials. It enables Xavier University faculty, staff, and students to make their work accessible to the world at a stable URL, 
and with the assurance they will be preserved over the long term. Digital Space @ Xavier is an important tool in advancing scholarly 
communication, promoting creative pedagogy and preserving the historical legacy of Xavier University. Digital Space @ Xavier is a 
service provided by the 
<a href="http://www.xavier.edu/cm/">Office of Content Management</a> under the auspices of the 
<a href="http://www.xavier.edu/information-resources/about/index.cfm">Division of Information Resources</a>.
</p>
<p><strong><a name="who" id="who"></a>Who may deposit their scholarly materials into Digital Space @ Xavier? </strong></p>

<p>All Xavier faculty, staff and students are eligible to deposit their scholarly, pedagogical, and historical materials into a 
Digital Space @ Xavier community. A community may include but is not limited to a college, department, center, institute, research unit, etc. 
Xavier faculty, staff and students may deposit their works in Digital Space @ Xavier if the content is appropriate for submission and if 
Xavier has their permission.
</p>
<p><strong><a name="why" id="why"></a>Why should I deposit my work in Digital Space @ Xavier? </strong></p>

and methods with no extra work on your part </li>
<li>Provides sophisticated searching, making your content easy for readers to find </li>
</ol>

<li>Guarantees permanence by assigning a stable, permanent URL to your work so readers will always find it </li>

http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/data_sharing/</a> )</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><a name="how" id="how"></a>How does Digital Space @ Xavier make my work discoverable? </strong></p>
<p>Works in Digital Space @ Xavier  that have text components (e.g. Microsoft Word and PDF documents) are searched full-text by 
Digital Space @ Xavier and by general search engines such as Google. In addition, more precise searching is accomplished by metadata 
records (descriptive cataloging information such as title, author, citation information, subject keywords, etc.) The terms entered into 
the metadata record  enable specialized search tools, as well as Google, to find documents much more effectively than full-text searching 
alone.
</p>
<p><strong><a name="materials" id="materials"></a>What kinds of materials are appropriate for Digital Space @ Xavier? </strong></p>
<p>Digital Space @ Xavier is specifically designed to house and make available scholarly, pedagogical and historical materials in a variety 
of digital formats (text, data, images, audio, video, etc.). Some examples of content include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Published materials</li>

<li>Pre- or post-prints (if the author&rsquo;s rights are retained)</li>

<li>Collections of photographs, art works, etc.</li>
<li>Learning objects</li>
<li>Historical materials</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a name="formats" id="formats"></a>What formats are supported? </strong></p>

<p>The system will accept any file format, though support for some formats is more robust than others. Xavier University will work to 
preserve as many of these file formats as possible.</p>
<p><strong><a name="copyright" id="copyright"></a>Who owns the copyright for scholarly materials at Xavier University? </strong></p>
<p>In general, authors (faculty, students, staff,) at Xavier University own the rights to their works of scholarship unless they have 
given those rights, in writing, to another party or have produced the work under a grant that required some other distribution of rights. 
Some examples of works of scholarship include:</p>

<li>journal articles</li>

<p><a name="cc" id="cc"></a><strong>How do I encourage others to use and build on my work?</strong></p>
<p>As an alternative to reserving all rights, authors are encouraged to consider licensing their works with a Creative Commons License, 
under which they can preserve those rights that are most important to them (e.g., proper attribution) and at the same time explicitly 
grant to readers certain other rights chosen by the author to be used at the readers discretion (e.g., copy, distribute, display, or 
perform the work.) Materials in Digital Space @ Xavier that are licensed under Creative Commons licenses will display the license conditions.

</ul>
<p><strong><a name="readersrights" id="readersrights"></a>What rights do readers have to my work? </strong></p>
<p>The purpose of Digital Space @ Xavier is to provide open access to Xavier University scholarly, pedagogical, and historical materials to 
researchers and other readers throughout the world, via the Web. By default, materials deposited into Digital Space @ Xavier are open access,
which means anyone on the web can access them. However, Digital Space @ Xavier materials are protected by copyright, with<strong> all rights 
reserved by the copyright holder</strong>. </p>
<p><strong><a name="contribute" id="contribute"></a>How do I contribute my work to Digital Space @ Xavier?</strong></p>
<p>Before Digital Space @ Xavier can showcase your scholarly, pedagogical, or historical materials we need your permission. We have created 
an online submission permission form and license that can be found at:</p>

<blockquote>
<p> <a href="http://www.xavier.edu/cm/digital-collections/permission_form.cfm">http://www.xavier.edu/cm/digital-collections/permission_form.cfm</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the work has multiple authors, each author must fill out the form and agree to the license, including any non-Xavier authors. 
In addition to the submission permission form, you must also send a copy of your work in digital format (e.g., MS Word or Adobe Acrobat PDF, 
etc.) to one of the contacts listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Michelle Early at 513 745-4817 or early@xavier.edu</li>
<li>Tim McCabe at 513 745-4821 or mccabe@xavier.edu</li>
<li>Marcia Poggione at 513 745-3971 or poggione@xavier.edu</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a name="start" id="start"></a>How do I set up my department in Digital Space @ Xavier? </strong></p>

<p>Its easy! Content in Digital Space @ Xavier is typically organized by department or unit into communities. Contact us to create a 
community for your department or unit. We will make every effort to assist you with site management, submission, or digitization of materials.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Michelle Early at 513 745-4817 or early@xavier.edu</li>
<li>Tim McCabe at 513 745-4821 or mccabe@xavier.edu</li>
<li>Marcia Poggione at 513 745-3971 or poggione@xavier.edu</li>
</ul>
<p>To get started, departments or units should decide on: </p>
<ul>
<li>What content they would like to distribute widely and preserve over the long-term </li>
<li>A contact person to work with the Digital Space @ Xavier team to set up and run the Community </li>

<li>The Community/Collection structure that is best for the department or unit </li>
<li>Individuals who will be allowed to submit materials </li>
</ul>
<p>Faculty may deposit any items they choose through their departmental community. The contacts listed above will explore establishing a 
community for your department if they do not yet have one, or will deposit your documents for you in an open community if a departmental 
community is not an option. Students may submit their scholarly materials through their department&rsquo;s community. </p>
<p><strong><a name="removals" id="removals"></a>Who may remove a file from Digital Space @ Xavier? </strong></p>
<p>Communities will set policies regarding the conditions under which files will be authorized for removal from Digital Space @ Xavier 
(e.g., author request for removal). Items will be withdrawn by Digital Space @ Xavier staff upon receipt of a written request from the 
administrator of a Digital Space @ Xavier community. In addition, the library and Xavier University retain the right to withdraw any item 
from Digital Space @ Xavier if they deem such action necessary.
</p>
<p>In order to avoid the loss of the historical record for items that are withdrawn from the repository, Digital Space @ Xavier will display 
a substitute citation for any withdrawn item noting that the item by this person, published on a specific date, with this title, and with this 
specific URL has been removed.? This will ensure that the URL never disappears even though the actual item has been withdrawn. 
</p>
